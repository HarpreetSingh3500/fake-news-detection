Fake News Detection System
📄 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to classify news articles as either "Real" or "Fake". The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text content and predict its authenticity. The entire workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to web-based deployment, is handled within this repository.

This project showcases a complete end-to-end data science and machine learning pipeline, demonstrating a practical understanding of how to build and deploy a real-world application.

✨ Key Features
Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly Flask application where users can input text and get an instant prediction.

Machine Learning Model: Employs a Passive Aggressive Classifier trained on a real-world news dataset.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implements text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

High Performance: The model achieves an impressive 95.57% accuracy on the test set.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for model training), NLTK (for text preprocessing), Pandas (for data manipulation).

Backend: Python, Flask (for building the web application).

Deployment: The project is designed to be easily deployed in a web environment.

⚙️ How It Works
The system follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

Data Preprocessing: The raw news dataset (train.csv) is loaded and cleaned. This involves dropping unnecessary columns and handling missing values.

Feature Extraction: The cleaned text data is converted into numerical features using a TF-IDF Vectorizer. This technique transforms text into a format suitable for the machine learning model.

Model Training: A Passive Aggressive Classifier is trained on the vectorized data. This is an efficient online-learning algorithm well-suited for large-scale text classification.

Prediction: The trained model and vectorizer are saved as pickle files (model.pkl, vector.pkl). The Flask application loads these files to make real-time predictions on new, user-provided text.

The model's performance metrics, including the confusion matrix and classification report, are thoroughly documented in the Fake_News_Detector-PA.ipynb notebook.

▶️ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git](https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git)
cd fake-news-detection

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask application:

python app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the application.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Advanced Models: Explore the use of more sophisticated models like LSTMs or Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for higher accuracy.

Real-time Data: Implement an API to fetch real-time news articles from sources like NewsAPI for continuous analysis and model updates.

Dockerization: Containerize the application using Docker to ensure consistent and portable deployment.
