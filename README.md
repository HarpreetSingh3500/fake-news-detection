- Text data is normalized and prepared for feature extraction

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transforms text into numerical features
- Captures the importance of words relative to the document and corpus
- Creates a sparse matrix suitable for machine learning algorithms

### 3. Model Training
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier**: An online learning algorithm ideal for text classification
- Efficient for large-scale datasets with good performance on text data
- Trained on vectorized news articles with binary classification (Real/Fake)

### 4. Text Processing Pipeline
```python
# Text preprocessing steps:
1. Remove special characters and punctuation
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Tokenization using NLTK
4. Remove stopwords
5. Lemmatization for word normalization
6. TF-IDF vectorization
7. Model prediction
```

### 5. Web Application
